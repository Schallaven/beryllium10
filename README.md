# Beryllium<sup>10</sup>: a free and simple tool for creating and managing group safety data sheets

![](resources/beryllium10.png){width=120}

## Introduction

Countless chemicals and mixtures are used in laboratories today, which all possess their own properties and dangers. Therefore, it is important to brief oneself about possible risks and hazards before doing any experiments. However, this task is laborious and time consuming.

Beryllium<sup>10</sup> supports users by carrying out a large part of the work such as collecting/importing data sets from different providers and compiling most of the information into a single group safety data sheet, which is suitable for having all necessary information at hand while an experiment is in progress.

A program for creating and managing of group safety data sheets was developed and released as open source under GPL. The program provides a fast and clear user-interface, and well-conceived design for collecting and managing safety data.

## Download and installation

Beryllium<sup>10</sup> is publicly available software (GNU GPL v3). It can be used, copied and distributed freely.

Currently, versions for Windows and Ubuntu are available for download from the old [web page](http://beryllium.keksecks.de). Future [releases](https://github.com/Schallaven/beryllium10/releases) will be available directly from this Github repository. Beryllium<sup>10</sup> is a portable application and does not require installation.

## Contributions

All contributions are welcome! In particular, I am looking for people that can contribute to the MacOS version and to updating/adding safety providers! If you (can) contribute, please specify if/how you want to be added to the contributors list!
